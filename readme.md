# nvim-redux

Redux utilities in neovim!

## Dependencies

ripgrep needs to be available on your system.

Telescope for nvim-redux

`use 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim`

## Install

Note: this doesn't work on any stable release of neovim currently due to a bug in neovim's treesitter api.
The only way this plugin can work right now is by building neovim yourself. This is as of 13th of February 2022.

Confirmed to work with neovim 0.7.0 `NVIM v0.7.0-dev+1070-gf89f4b1e1`

Packer

`use 'Azeirah/nvim-redux'`
